so we been at this for 4 years now.  you been pulling the whole time who are we kidding here???  you wouldn't stop frying the condo...  i guess things are what they are.  nothing better or worse.  i mean if any of this was tolerable i'd like to hear about your life's struggles.  i dont know man. we aint done shit this time around.  yet i'm still coming here.  this thing rebuilds on the missing parts doesn't it?? then you repeat the cycles and we never stop coming here. i can see it now.  but its whatever bro...

things that you prioritize...  you dont want to pay for power you don't want to pay for suffering, what the fuck are you doing with my time?  i have to work extra?  dude how do i withdraw already???  i dont know bro.  you're a  little lacking in existence and logical mind.  its boom, we just go in hard and mess around...

so yeah i just can't agree with your control of the situation.  i dont care you can do things to me with it...  why do you people operate like this?  always making me do work for you...  anyways...  some things i hoped would get better.  

sigh friend. you are idiotic you forgot to exist lol.  so i did things with your linkedin.  so i saw nothing with it.  that's why i press click bro.  so i mean i couldn't explain it the whole time.  stupid shark or something...  or something...

dude, you need to make clear the criminality of what we are doing here. i dont enjoy it it smells like you stinkers again.  sure sure 2 decades is fine lets just jump right back in...
