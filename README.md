so we been at this for 4 years now.  you been pulling the whole time who are we kidding here???  you wouldn't stop frying the condo...  i guess things are what they are.  nothing better or worse.  i mean if any of this was tolerable i'd like to hear about your life's struggles.  i dont know man. we aint done shit this time around.  yet i'm still coming here.  this thing rebuilds on the missing parts doesn't it?? then you repeat the cycles and we never stop coming here. i can see it now.  but its whatever bro...

things that you prioritize...  you dont want to pay for power you don't want to pay for suffering, what the fuck are you doing with my time?  i have to work extra?  dude how do i withdraw already???  i dont know bro.  you're a  little lacking in existence and logical mind.  its boom, we just go in hard and mess around...

so yeah i just can't agree with your control of the situation.  i dont care you can do things to me with it...  why do you people operate like this?  always making me do work for you...  anyways...  some things i hoped would get better.  

sigh friend. you are idiotic you forgot to exist lol.  so i did things with your linkedin.  so i saw nothing with it.  that's why i press click bro.  so i mean i couldn't explain it the whole time.  stupid shark or something...  or something...

dude, you need to make clear the criminality of what we are doing here. i dont enjoy it it smells like you stinkers again.  sure sure 2 decades is fine lets just jump right back in...

ohh i get how it works now...  this mind recognizes this place as brain repair lol.  of course i can't leave. and i think things out on here.  its just too much utility to overlook it...

you i would expect to understand the previous sentences but whatever bro.  lost in translation.  you ask for things the way they are and i present them to you like this and we been at it for 4 years coming up to 5 now.  i mean, you guys are eating the sharkies surprise...  dont make what is on your dinner plate something recognizeable...

and the high insanity comes into play here.  i have never told you about it now haven't i???  the one where i expect things to get done.  i'm completely blind i have no idea what the target is and what i decide to do saves my ass.  i wonder if i would just head down there and smash some glass bro...  that seemingly enough, you should honor your hypnosis.  its bad karma in the pool dude.  if we had leeches at every step it would not work out...

so some things have not been fixed you guys.  the monees is over due.  you don't own sharkey rights.  i should let you two go at it until somebody decides to take responsibility...
