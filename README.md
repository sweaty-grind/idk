so i figured out a final solution.  give me a second to recall it cause i just forgot it...  oh shit i don't remember it.  wtf.  that's short term memory loss for you.

it was something about being a nice person.  that was what it was about.  oh yeah i'm starting to remember it.  i complain about the monees but it doesn't matter what i do.  its all on you.  that's what i figured out.  how does this line of logic work?? well.  you haven't paid yet so you are definitely not paying or taking your sweet time.  the fact you spent so much was because you needed it this way.  so i have hope you are indeed just stalling for time lol.  cause the other option is just wasting my time.  but you wouldn't waste 4 years of my life for a peak that lasts 2 more years bro???

i understand there is nothing left to lose.  i know it.  i just needed it paid off.  this brain lacks understanding of payment. i've never been properly paid for shit dude.  cause it was never worth my time.  and that's the moral of the story and i wonder where you fit on this line.  so i wonder sometimes why i deal with you but eager enough i run back in to find something to do.  which makes me a good person but unfortunately it also makes me a bad person the reason why i tried fixing things.  some shit like that.  you know what i'm talking about.  and what's with this one cell policy???  you ask too much bro. what if i don't agree my super powers are not to be used a certain way? then what?  would you listen?  would you factor in even?

so i'm tired and i realized i have not had much energy drinks and i come here to tell you things that end up costing me energy and more energy and i dont know where this goes.  i'm fatigued bro.
