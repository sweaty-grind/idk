so we been at this for 4 years now.  you been pulling the whole time who are we kidding here???  you wouldn't stop frying the condo...  i guess things are what they are.  nothing better or worse.  i mean if any of this was tolerable i'd like to hear about your life's struggles.  i dont know man. we aint done shit this time around.  yet i'm still coming here.  this thing rebuilds on the missing parts doesn't it?? then you repeat the cycles and we never stop coming here. i can see it now.  but its whatever bro...

things that you prioritize...  you dont want to pay for power you don't want to pay for suffering, what the fuck are you doing with my time?  i have to work extra?  dude how do i withdraw already???  i dont know bro.  you're a  little lacking in existence and logical mind.  its boom, we just go in hard and mess around...

so yeah i just can't agree with your control of the situation.  i dont care you can do things to me with it...  why do you people operate like this?  always making me do work for you...  anyways...  some things i hoped would get better.  

sigh friend. you are idiotic you forgot to exist lol.  so i did things with your linkedin.  so i saw nothing with it.  that's why i press click bro.  so i mean i couldn't explain it the whole time.  stupid shark or something...  or something...

dude, you need to make clear the criminality of what we are doing here. i dont enjoy it it smells like you stinkers again.  sure sure 2 decades is fine lets just jump right back in...

ohh i get how it works now...  this mind recognizes this place as brain repair lol.  of course i can't leave. and i think things out on here.  its just too much utility to overlook it...

you i would expect to understand the previous sentences but whatever bro.  lost in translation.  you ask for things the way they are and i present them to you like this and we been at it for 4 years coming up to 5 now.  i mean, you guys are eating the sharkies surprise...  dont make what is on your dinner plate something recognizeable...

and the high insanity comes into play here.  i have never told you about it now haven't i???  the one where i expect things to get done.  i'm completely blind i have no idea what the target is and what i decide to do saves my ass.  i wonder if i would just head down there and smash some glass bro...  that seemingly enough, you should honor your hypnosis.  its bad karma in the pool dude.  if we had leeches at every step it would not work out...

so some things have not been fixed you guys.  the monees is over due.  you don't own sharkey rights.  i should let you two go at it until somebody decides to take responsibility...

yes i am tired of doing this with you guys.  not cause its free.  cause its useless lol.  who doesn't pay for shit right??  2 decades later lol.  you see where i'm coming from???  i must see.  something something.  who cares.  bro.  you didn't pay for anything here lool.  so i mean it was all on me.  ate the bait to get a voice in somewhere...  did i ever tell you that i dont know what i'm doing???  i think that's important or something bro.  i dont know man.  i thought we would play some sort of new game other than the spiral of fear in the mirror...  dont understand it. you can't.  lol.  its about the coming of the events and you made it nasty and i only used half  my brain at the time...

you see...  this issue of brain power is sorta too much for me to bear.  i am crushed under the weight of everything before me.  it doesn't help that i dont really care about this but you make paramount...

so i have spare time right now for some reason.  i'm ahead my life for once...  i stopped getting drowned by sharkey...  dude he used to be so hard to control lol.  i sometimes wonder the value of what we do and i have to ask you why you are in overtime with this thing and no sign of payment.  your bill you racked up is pretty hefty.  pay all debts lol.  sometimes you don't want it.  lol.  i quickly found the courage for that.  its cause i don't feel deterrence...

so yup, this mind is wonkers i give up.  i damaged it doing all those pills ffs.  oh well i guess this is to be managed by me.  lol.  i dont know bro. i come here to frame of reference my life and it doesn't look fun...  i dont think i've enjoyed this thing ever since okay coolit money was a thing...  make a deal with me did you????

so anyways, i dont' know what else to talk about other than life logics.  this sucks big time.  i can't even catch my own breathe.  sigh.  i guess i stayed friendly to get bonuses lol...  why you think you can offer that here?  it makes no sense bro.  weird...

frame of reference says you dont know what you're doing and this randomness is to be probed...

oh well its another stupid day.  who cares about making a mess...
