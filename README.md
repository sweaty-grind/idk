world...  stop asking me for it.  how about the shit you steal from me that you need so badly means your protocols are fucked up.  no priority...  oh well it is what it is.  sometimes i see your friend on my dinner plate so i just do suckle.  brains are tasty...

you know it shows some sign of perseverance.  you would steal so much at any costs...  i must say whoever decided this at the start already fucked up before they started...  good grief charlie brown...

anyways, i come by with coke zero caffeine stimulant.  not worth very much but something nonetheless...  you can't even replace monsters cause its so messed up already.  the caffeine are pretty rough if you drink like pepsi zero...  i guess pepsi was always the weaker option...

sometimes though. i come here with the hopes you aren't a retard.  did i ever tell you this??  even though you act this way sharkey is about this much also.  is this some sort of power structure i'm not aware of???  i know i'm at the bottom i cna't fuck up anything when we compare your shit to mine.  i own your shit i dont own mine. i wonder why.  really though...  anyways, its been a good day.  i'm starting to understand its not good to spawn this demon...  energy expenditure is through the roof.  my neurons are fried.  you did that.  lots of damage.  does this make it the best it can be?? i wonder you guys. you give me money and there was a road block in it...

so honestly i see no value in what we do cause its so weird.  but i wonder sometimes you are full of shit you could defy this shark...  honestly though, you should have left things alone...  blah blah you were meant for this blah blah.  sharkey likes to take sacrifices if you haven't noticed by now...  i dont know bro.  i'm liberated but the shark still sitting there with his sharp nose.
