dude.  this non stop working alll day i dont know how to stop doing the wavelength business i dont know what's going on and you tell me sometimes its okay.  but then i dont believe it and we can't move forward.  like the monees.  you promised me it but you haven't paid in 4 years and the troubles you caused to me.  not also the damage to my dignity...  add it up and you already in deep doo doo.  i wonder you made it so that i would sue you for payment.  it was a pathway to go but okay whatever.  so you tell me what i'm supposed to do.  you don't clone anymore.  that's good.  something new. i was getting annoyed at that useless thing.  sorry it was just too fucked up bro.
